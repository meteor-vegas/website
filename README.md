## <a name="features-overview"></a> Features Overview

### Meetup.com Integration

* One-click sign in with Meetup.com OAuth integration
* Pulls new meetup events from Meetup.com every 30 minutes
* Displays members who have RSVP'd on Meetup.com
* Allows members to RSVP to meetups directly from your site

### Meetups
Create your meetup on Meetup.com as usual, and the event will be added to your site within 30 minutes (or manually via the button on the `/meetups` page). Once it is on your site, you can add topics and presenters, and even feature it on your homepage.

### Topics
The topics page allows your members to suggest topics that they would like to hear about in upcoming meetups. Other members can vote on and discuss the topics, allowing the organizers to easily choose which topics should be presented next.

### Presentations
The presentations page gives you a centralized location to store all of your group's presentations. Members can upload their presentations to YouTube, SlideShare, etc, and simply paste a link into the "Add Presentation" form.

### Member Activity
Members are granted activity points when performing certain activities. These points are displayed on their profile, and the member list is sorted by those with the most points.

* Liked a Presentation: 5 points
* Commented on a Presentation: 5 points
* Voted on a Topic: 5 points
* Commented on a Topic: 5 points
* Suggested a Topic: 10 points
* Added a Presentation: 10 points
* RSVP'd to a Meetup: 10 points
* Presented a Topic at a Meetup: 50 points

### Coupons
You can add in `settings.json` an objects with coupons. When a member found a coupon code urls, he can use this url to automatically won the points related to this coupon. In the settings.example.json, it could be `http://localhost:3000/coupons/mdb`.

For example, people who RSVP won 5 points. And during the event, organizers can give the coupon link to people who really are in the event to win more points.

It's a very good way to reward members who help Meteor community.

### Basic Info

Your group's name, description, Meetup URL, Twitter and Github links and even sponsors can all be customized via the `settings.json` file.

### Design / Branding

This app uses Less and Bootstrap for easy customization. Simply change or add Less variables in `client/stylesheets/variables.import.less` to change your brand colors or modify the theme.

Additionally, we make use of [CSS blend modes](http://css-tricks.com/basics-css-blend-modes/) to dynamically change the color of background images based on your `$brand-primary` color. As an example:
